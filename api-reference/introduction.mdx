## Welcome

The Inrconnect API enables developers to securely access and manage data
from their organizations. With a simple API key, you can integrate
Inrconnect into your workflows, sync data, and build automations.

This documentation is generated directly from our
[OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification](./openapi.json), ensuring it is always up to date.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via an **API Key** passed in the
request header:

```http
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

This is defined in the OpenAPI specification as:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "ApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```

You can generate and manage your API keys from the Inrconnect Dashboard.

## Base URLs

**Production:** `https://api.inrconnect.com`

## Next Steps

Start with the `GET /organization` endpoint to verify your integration and retrieve your organization details.

Explore additional endpoints as your integration grows.
