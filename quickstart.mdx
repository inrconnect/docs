    1. Log in to your Housecall Pro account.  
    2. In the top navigation bar, click the **grid icon** (next to your profile).  
    3. Select **Go to App store** from the dropdown.

### Step 3: Configure your webhook URL and secret

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Add your Inrconnect webhook URL">
    1. Copy your unique Inrconnect webhook URL from the dashboard.  
       Example: `https://events.inrconnect.cloud/your-unique-id`  
    2. Paste it into the **Webhook URL** field in Housecall Pro.  
    3. Copy the **Signing Secret** provided—this will be needed inside Inrconnect to verify requests.  
    4. Click **Save**.
